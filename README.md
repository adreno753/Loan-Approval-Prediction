Loan Approval Prediction: EDA, Feature Engineering, and Modeling
This project predicts loan approval decisions using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and building multiple models to achieve high accuracy.

Project Overview
The goal is to predict whether a loan will be approved based on features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, etc. The project follows the complete data science pipeline from EDA to model evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset contains information on loan applicants, including:

Loan_ID
Gender
Married
Dependents
ApplicantIncome
LoanAmount
Credit_History
Project Structure
Data: Raw and processed data
Notebooks: Contains the main Jupyter notebook for EDA, feature engineering, and modeling
Models: Saved models
EDA and Feature Engineering
EDA was performed to analyze trends and identify relationships between variables. Feature engineering included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

Modeling
Multiple models were trained, including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
Decision Tree
The models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

Results
The Random Forest model achieved the best accuracy, with Credit_History and LoanAmount being the most influential features.

Conclusion
This project provides a strong approach to loan approval prediction using machine learning techniques. It highlights the importance of feature engineering and model selection to achieve high accuracy.

Technologies Used
